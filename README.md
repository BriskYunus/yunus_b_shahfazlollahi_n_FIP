We wanted to create an easy to flow page that is usable on Desktop and Mobile. We also did a responsive tablet layout so it can be viewed on all platforms. 

We changed the nav bar to make it easier to use, before it was sticky but in this version we replaced it with a handburger icon that stay on top. We also added a "Top" button that appears once the user scrolls down the page. This button takes them back to the nav so they can quicky change sections. However, this hamburger icon only appears in mobile version.

We still wanted this page to have flow similar to the midterm we created, but changed the colors to a more appropriate tone similar to the original site. There is now a white background with green tones throughout the website.

We wanted to user to have easy access to this site so we replace the slideshow banner with a video that autoplays on desktop mode. This video ends up getting replaced on tablet to mobile so it is data friendly and we believe on mobile, people are quicker to view sites so instead of completely removing it we added a replacment.

We also created our own video and some images that are low in size to style our page.
